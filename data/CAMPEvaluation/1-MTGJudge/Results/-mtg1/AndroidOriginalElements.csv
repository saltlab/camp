S5,E7,TextView,100. General  100.1. These _Magic_ rules apply to any _Magic_ game with two or more players; including two-player games and multiplayer games.  100.1a A two-player game is a game that begins with only two players.  100.1b A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. See section 8; "Multiplayer Rules."  100.2. To play; each player needs his or her own deck of traditional _Magic_ cards; small items to represent any tokens and counters; and some way to clearly track life totals.  100.2a In constructed play (a way of playing in which each player creates his or her own deck ahead of time); each deck must contain at least sixty cards. A constructed deck may contain any number of basic land cards and no more than four of any card with a particular English name other than basic land cards.  100.2b In limited play (a way of playing in which each player gets the same quantity of unopened _Magic_ product and creates his or her own deck using only this product); each deck must contain at least forty cards. A limited deck may contain as many duplicates of a card as are included with the product.  100.3. Some casual variants require additional items; such as specially designated cards; nontraditional _Magic_ cards; and dice. See section 9; "Casual Variants."  100.4. Each player may also have a sideboard; which is a group of additional cards the player may use to modify his or her deck between games of a match.  100.4a In constructed play; sideboards are optional; but must contain exactly fifteen cards if used. The four-card limit (see rule 100.2a) applies to the combined deck and sideboard.  100.4b In limited play involving individual players; all cards a player opens but doesn't include in his or her deck are in that player's sideboard.  100.4c In limited play involving the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant; all cards a team opens but doesn't include in either player's deck are in that team's sideboard.  100.4d In limited play involving other multiplayer team variants; each card a team opens but doesn't include in any player's deck is assigned to the sideboard of one of those players. Each player has his or her own sideboard; cards may not be transferred between players.  100.5. There is no maximum deck size.  100.6. Most _Magic_ tournaments (organized play activities where players compete against other players to win prizes) have additional rules covered in the _Magic: The Gathering_ Tournament Rules (found at www.wizards.com/wpn/Events/Rules.aspx). These rules may limit the use of some cards; including barring all cards from some older sets.  100.6a Tournaments usually consist of a series of matches. A two-player match usually involves playing until one player has won two games. A multiplayer match usually consists of only one game.  100.6b Players can use the _Magic_ Store & Event Locator at www.wizards.com/locator to find tournaments in their area.,,,
