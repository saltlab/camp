S1,E42,TextView,Thank you for participating!  Roadkill Reporter is a mobile app that allows you to participate in a parasitology project exploring the genetics and distribution of the raccoon roundworm; an intestinal parasite infecting 60–80% of raccoons in the Midwest. Specimens for this project come primarily from road–killed raccoons; and this app allows you to pinpoint and report the location of a roadkill. The principal investigators of this project will see the location of your entry on a map; and be able to retrieve the specimen for analysis.  Things to consider • Please do NOT use this app while driving! Please pull over before reporting. • You will have the option later of refining the location of the roadkill you saw. • Don’t touch the roadkill! That’s our job. • Raccoons only please. • Your participation is completely anonymous • This project is based on samples obtained from West Michigan only; so reports out of that location will not be monitored.
